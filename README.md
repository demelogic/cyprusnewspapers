cyprusnewspapers
================
The objective of this project is to obtain the daily frontpages of Cypriot newspapers and display them on a website. It is developing an easier quicker way to read papers and obtain news. Most papers contain the majority of their news headlines on the "front page"!

It began with cypriot papers, then expanded to frontpages of Cypriot magazines and plans to extend further to Greek papers etc.

In the future I have the idea to cache in some way Cypriot news websites ("frontpage of website") so a user can scroll through (like in a carousel style) which websites they would like to read / navigate to by previewing the daily cached image prior to visiting the site.

I will have a cron job scraping the front page newspaper images multiple times daily, and plan to probably do the same with the cached webpage images.

The scraping and displaying of the papers is done in .php and website hosted in Joomla. sample/demo can be found at: http://www.cyprusnewspapers.eu

However I want to create the site from scratch in order to learn/practise my html5, jquery, javascript, php This will allow me to add features the way I want them to be added and allow others to collaborate and add their ideas.

All Help / ideas are welcomed
